# 🎨 Stylization Report: Glassmorphism Design Update

This document tracks the files that have been updated to adopt the new **Glassmorphism** design language (UI UX Pro Max) for the Image Converter App.

## 📱 Screens

### 1. **Profile Screen** (`lib/screens/profile_screen.dart`)
*   **Background**: Applied standard `AppStyles.homeBackground` gradient with floating blobs (Blue/Purple).
*   **Header**: Integrated `AppHeader` for consistent navigation and "Refresh" action.
*   **Cards**:
    *   **Profile Info**: Converted to a glassmorphism card with a glowing avatar border.
    *   **Storage Usage**: Redesigned as a glass card with a modern progress bar and clear data hierarchy.
*   **Menu**: Grouped settings options into a single glass container for a cleaner look.
*   **Typography**: Updated to use `AppColors.textPrimary` (Slate 800) for better readability.

### 2. **Settings Screen** (`lib/screens/settings_screen.dart`)
*   **Background**: Synchronization with Home/Profile screens (Gradient + Blobs).
*   **Layout**: Switched to `CustomScrollView` with `AppHeader`.
*   **Components**:
    *   **Switches/Tiles**: Wrapped in `_buildGlassCard` containers.
    *   **Font Size Slider**: Added a live "Preview Box" and refined slider visuals.
    *   **Language Selector**: Modernized tile design with flag icons and checkmark indicators.

### 3. **Downloaded Files Screen** (`lib/screens/downloaded_files/downloaded_files_screen.dart`)
*   **Layout**: Synchronized list view styling with `HistoryList`.
*   **Cards**: Implemented glassmorphism for file items (`_buildFileCard`) using `BackdropFilter`.
*   **Select Mode**: Enhanced the UI for selection mode (checkboxes, action bar) to be more intuitive.

## 🧩 Widgets & Dialogs

### 4. **Image Source Modal** (`lib/screens/home/widgets/image_source_modal.dart`)
*   **Style**: Transformed from a default bottom sheet to a translucent glass modal.
*   **Buttons**: created large, gradient-styled buttons for "Camera" and "Gallery" with shadow effects.
*   **Animation**: Improved touch feedback and overall visual polish.

### 5. **Merge PDF Dialog** (`lib/screens/home/widgets/merge_pdf_dialog.dart`)
*   **Container**: Full glassmorphism background.
*   **List Items**: Transparent styling for file items with selection highlights (borders + ordering badges).
*   **Interactions**: Added "Selection Chips" to clearly show the order of files to be merged.
*   **Empty State**: Added a custom empty state icon and message.

## 🎨 Theme & Core Support

### 6. **App Colors** (`lib/theme/app_colors.dart`)
*   **New Token**: Added `textPrimary` (`Color(0xFF1E293B)` - Slate 800) to standardize main text color usage across the new screens.
